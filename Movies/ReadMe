The above works fine.

The Put method I could not get it to work as it failed with syntax error (postman console output the error but could not resolve this)
Section D I could not get it to work either.

I would have logging for all the errors, would also have a test project in the solution for unit testing to make it easier for any future enhancements and retest existing methods.
